Hello, this is an open source Python library that serves as an interface to FreshBooks.
The code is heavily based on the existing Ruby implementation 
by Ben Vinegar of the same interface:
    http://freshbooks.rubyforge.org/
    
USAGE:

    import freshbooks
    
    freshbooks.setup('YOU.freshbooks.com', '<YOUR AUTH TOKEN>')
    clients = freshbooks.Client.list()
    client_1 = freshbooks.Client.get(<client_id>)
